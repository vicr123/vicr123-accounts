Hi {user}!

Looks like you've switched off Two Factor Authentication for your Victor Tran account.

From now on, when you log in, you'll only need your password.

In order to switch Two Factor Authentication back on, go ahead and visit the Account screen in any Victor Tran application.

If this wasn't you, reply to this email to let us know immediately, as your account might have been compromised.

Best Regards,
- Victor Tran

P.S. This email not for you? Reply to this message and we'll sort it out. Thanks!
