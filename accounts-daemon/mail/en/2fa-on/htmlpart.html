        Two Factor Authentication was enabled for your Victor Tran account

        <p>Hi {user}!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Looks like you've switched on Two Factor Authentication for your Victor Tran account. Congratulations on levelling up your security!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From now on, when you log in, you'll be asked for both your password and the 6 digit code that is generated on your mobile device.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you're here, we'll take this moment to urge you to <b>save your backup codes</b> - they'll be handy in case your mobile device is unavailable when you need to log in. Each code can only be used once, but you can regenerate them at any time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In order to manage Two Factor Authentication, or to regenerate your backup codes, go ahead and visit the Account screen in any Victor Tran application.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If this wasn't you, reply to this email to let us know immediately, as your account might have been compromised.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Best Regards,</p>
        <p>- Victor Tran</p>
