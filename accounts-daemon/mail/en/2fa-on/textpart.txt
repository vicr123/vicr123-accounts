Hi {user}!

Looks like you've switched on Two Factor Authentication for your Victor Tran account. Congratulations on levelling up your security!

From now on, when you log in, you'll be asked for both your password and the 6 digit code that is generated on your mobile device.

While you're here, we'll take this moment to urge you to save your backup codes - they'll be handy in case your mobile device is unavailable when you need to log in. Each code can only be used once, but you can regenerate them at any time.

In order to manage Two Factor Authentication, or to regenerate your backup codes, go ahead and visit the Account screen in any Victor Tran application.

If this wasn't you, reply to this email to let us know immediately, as your account might have been compromised.

Best Regards,
- Victor Tran

P.S. This email not for you? Reply to this message and we'll sort it out. Thanks!
