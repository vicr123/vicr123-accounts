Hi {user}!

Looks like you've regenerated your Two Factor Authentication backup codes.

Your old backup codes have now stopped working, so the only valid backup codes now are the ones that were just generated.

You can use these backup codes instead of a Two Factor Authentication code if you can't access your mobile device. Each code can only be used once, but you can regenerate them at any time.

In order to manage Two Factor Authentication, or to regenerate your backup codes, go ahead and visit the Account screen in any Victor Tran application.

If this wasn't you, reply to this email to let us know immediately, as your account might have been compromised.

Best Regards,
- Victor Tran

P.S. This email not for you? Reply to this message and we'll sort it out. Thanks!
