Hi {user}!

Looks like you've added a new passkey, {key}, to your Victor Tran account. Congratulations on levelling up your security!

From now on, you'll have the option to log in with this passkey instead of your password (and Two Factor Authentication code if Two Factor Authentication is on)

Since you registered this passkey in {application}, you'll only be able to log in using this passkey in {application}. If you need to, you can register the same passkey in different applications.

In order to manage your passkeys, go ahead and visit the Account screen in any Victor Tran application.

If this wasn't you, reply to this email to let us know immediately, as your account might have been compromised.

Best Regards,
- Victor Tran

P.S. This email not for you? Reply to this message and we'll sort it out. Thanks!
